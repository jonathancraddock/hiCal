## hical (AKA: Hi Calendar!)

My first repository, which is something like a "Hello World", but this is "Hi Calendar". I'm using it as a way to get an introduction to Atom and GitHub. Some notes below:

**Atom** (running on Windows machine, using **Remote-FTP** package to stay in sync with a Digital Ocean VM.)

1. `git clone https://github.com/jonathancraddock/hiCal.git`
2. Created/edited files in Atom, saved.
3. `git status`
4. `git add -A`
5. `git commit -m "Initial prototype to test calendar layout"`
6. `git push`
7. Refreshed GitHub page and can see updates.

Test page is live at https://jonathancraddock.com/hical/

Updated this README. Helpful syntax cheatsheet here https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
